A
      perspective defines the initial set and layout of views in the Workbench
      window. Within the window, each perspective shares the same set of
      editors. Each perspective provides a set of capabilities aimed at
      accomplishing a specific type of task or works with specific types of
      resources. For example, the Java perspective combines views that you
      would commonly use while editing Java source files, while the Debug
      perspective contains the views that you would use while debugging Java
      programs. As you work in the Workbench, you will probably switch
      perspectives frequently.</p><p>Perspectives control what appears in certain menus and toolbars.
      They define visible <span class="emphasis"><em>action sets</em></span>, which you can
      change to customize a perspective. You can save a perspective that you
      build in this manner, making your own custom perspective that you can
      open again later.</p><p>You can set your Workbench preferences to open perspectives in the
      same window or in a new window.</p><p>The main perspectives for developing Perl applications are:</p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/perl_perspective_symbol.gif" alt="Perl Perspective" /></span> This is the main perspective for coding Perl
      scripts.</p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/debug_perspective_symbol.gif" alt="Debug Perspective" /></span> Provides the main functionality for debugging and
      executing Perl scripts. For details see <a href="ch06s04.html" title="Views in the Debug Perspective">the section called “Views in the Debug Perspective”</a>.</p></div></body></html>
